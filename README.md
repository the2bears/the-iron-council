## Features

  * Player controlled gunship, with yaw movement (either in the direction of left/right movement, or opposite it). **Done**
  * Battle against a massive, heavily fortified train. And maybe more.
  * BulletML patterns for enemy bullets.
  * Choice of auxiliary weapon: extra cannons or rockets
  * *Some* type of procedurally generated terrain.

## How to try it out?

Clone the repository and build it locally with Lein. You'll also need my [pixel-ships](https://github.com/the2bears/pixel-ships) library and my fork of [play-clj](https://github.com/the2bears/play-clj) (Why? The Box2D shapes won't overlap correctly with the textures during rotation without my patch). Build and install these locally.
